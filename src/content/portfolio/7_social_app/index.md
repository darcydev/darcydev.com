A social media application that allows Users to post, share, like, and comment on each other's posts. The application will also recommend Users to follow. The application is built using React/Redux, along with Express and Firebase. Using React Router, it fetches data based on the URL, so you can easily reload the page and the data will continue to be fetched. Along with the use of lazy loading on images and error handling, it is a very performant application.
