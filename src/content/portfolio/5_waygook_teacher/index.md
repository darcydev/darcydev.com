An application to connect language-learners around the world. The app allows a User to join as either a teacher/student, and complete their profile, send messages to teachers/students, and book lessons. Through PayPal, the application also acts an intermediary for each lesson. The motivation for building the application was to easily enable people to find and conveniently online language-learning lessons, something I experienced personally while living in Korea.
