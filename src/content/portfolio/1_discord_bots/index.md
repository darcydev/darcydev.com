Discord Bots to automate various alerts and actions! The Bots are tailored toward the financial markets community and provide price alerts when various different price conditions are satisfied. Accordingly, each alert is based off a different algorithm that can be adjusted to apply to each particular market. I often worked with several other developers to build the most accurate algorithm to reflect specific price alert required.
