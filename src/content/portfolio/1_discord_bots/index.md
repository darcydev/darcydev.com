As freelance projects, I have built several Discord Bots for various different circumstances, ranging from promotional material, admin duties, to price alerts. Specifically, the Bots are tailored toward the financial markets community and give price alerts when various different price conditions are satisfied. Accordingly, each alert is based off a different algorithm that can be adjusted to apply to each particular financial market. For each Bot, I often worked with several other developers to build the most accurate algorithm to reflect specific price alert required.
