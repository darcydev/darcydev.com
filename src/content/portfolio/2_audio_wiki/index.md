A simple app that allows a User to search for and listen to Wikipedia articles! The simple project was inspired as a fan of audio books and multitasking in general. The User can adjust the voice, rate and pitch to suit them. The app fetches the articles using the MediaWiki API and speaks them using the WebSpeech API.
