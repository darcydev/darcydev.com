I’m <span>Darcy</span>, a 29 years' old self-taught <span>developer</span>, from Australia. After my graduating from Law School, I pursued a career in <span>corporate law</span> in London, United Kingdom. After two years as a lawyer, I _felt stuck_ and, through work, undertook a three-month secondment with an NGO in India working on technology and app solutions for off-grid solar energy. The opportunities exposed me to the power of technology to affect significant and positive change in the community. I decided that it was _time for a change_, so I start to <span>study JavaScript</span> before going into work.

Since November 2018, I started working as a <span>freelance developer</span>, with <span>2+ years' of commercial experience</span> I have focused on front-end applications, but have also built several full-stack and back-end applications! I have also done a bunch of personal projects. You can check them on my <scroll-link to='portfolio'>portfolio</scroll-link>.

I always want to _learn more_, _create more_, _do more_, and _be more_. I’m _hard working_, _super curious_, _passionate_, _committed_, and also a _fast learner_!

Away from the desk, I enjoy surfing and stand-up comedy.
